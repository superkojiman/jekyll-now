Hello Internet! My name is Harold. If you're here, you probably know me as *superkojiman*. Here are some things about me:

* I work in offensive security, primarily in penetration testing and red teaming. 
* I code, sometimes. Most of it is on [GitHub](https://github.com/superkojiman). 
* Occasionally I [break things](https://github.com/superkojiman/vulnerabilities) and write about them. 
* I contribute to [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/?q=Brainpan&sort=date-asc&type=vm) with my Brainpan boot2root challenges! Take them for a spin!
* I used to hack with the [VulnHub CTF Team](https://github.com/VulnHub/ctf-writeups/). I liked to tackle pwnables and reverse engineering challenges. Sometimes I'd get a shell.
* I hold the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/), [OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/ctp-osce/), and [CRTO](https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/red-team-ops) certifications. It means I'm stubborn and I try harder. 
* When I'm not hacking, I may be lock picking. I think I'm fairly good at it.
* Learning new things is fun. I like to learn new things.
* I like coffee.
